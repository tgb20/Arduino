   Use an Ultrasonic distance sensor, part 2

   The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor has a trigger pin and an echo pin.
   Sending a signal to the trigger pin causes an ultrasonic
   sound to be broadcast. We can detect how long it takes for the echo
   to be heard and calculate the distance using the speed of sound.

   This lesson adds a dimmable LED controlled by the distance sensor.
