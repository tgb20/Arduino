Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.

  - Low cost scientific instruments
  - Robotics
  - Interactive prototypes
  - New musical instruments
  - Cool, fun inventions!

What made Arduino Popular?
  - Easy to use
  - Flexible for Advanced Users
  - Works with almost anything

# What do you want to invent?

# What can an Arduino Do?

Arduino can read **inputs**:
- Light on a Sensor
- a finger on a button
- a twitter message

And turn them into an **output**:
- activating a motor
- turning on an LED
- publishing something online

# How does an Arduino Work?
An Arduino has many components:
- A USB Input, this is used to talk to the Arduino from a computer to load code or send Serial Data
- Input/Output Pins, these pins are used to send and recieve signals from sensors and other devices, such as the examples above.
- The Arduino also has 5v and 3.5v power outputs that are passed through from the USB cable or a dedicated power supply. You also need a ground to complete every circuit
# How does a Circuit Work?
# How do LEDs Work?
# How do Resistors Work?
# What is a breadboard?
# How do you program and Arduino?

# Summary
This is the end of the introduction for Arduinos! You should now have a basic understanding of how an Arduino works and have a working sample project. In the next lesson we will go over connecting a distance sensor to the Arduino.
